## Project Outline

### Tentative Target Users
-

### Problem to Solve
- The cafe industry in South Korea grows rapidly. The number of cafes in South Korea had increased 15% from 2020 to 2021 even during the COVID-Pandemic. 10,000 cafes are founded annually, but the exit rate of self-employed cafes recorded 12% in 2021. Unlike franchise cafes, self-employed cafes need to demonstrate their own identity and own story to customers. However, there are too many steps to open a cafe as an individual like market research, real estate contact, material supply, interior construction, etc. Therefore, we are going to create a platform where self-employed cafe owners can share their own founding stories. 

### Existing or Related Solutions (Competitors)
- There are two major existing services called ChangUp in(창업인 = Start up people) and MyPuCha(마이프차 = My Franchise).

* [**ChangUp in**](https://changupin.kr/) provides group chatting services to current owners and potential owners. 

* [**MyPuCha**](https://myfranchise.kr/) is a  franchise community and platform for both current and potential franchise owners.

### Plan for survey or interview
