## Project Outline

### Tentative Target Users
- Owners of the Cafe
: Get the insight and tips to manage the cafe; especially sharing difficulties for managing the cafe and interior tips for the cafe
- Potential owners of the Cafe
: People who are struggling to open their shop with their brands

### Problem to Solve
- The cafe industry in South Korea grows rapidly. The number of cafes in South Korea had increased 15% from 2020 to 2021 even during the COVID-Pandemic. 10,000 cafes are founded annually, but the exit rate of self-employed cafes recorded 12% in 2021. Unlike franchise cafes, self-employed cafes need to demonstrate their own identity and own story to customers. However, there are too many steps to open a cafe as an individual like market research, real estate contact, material supply, interior construction, etc. Therefore, we are going to create a platform where self-employed cafe owners can share their own founding stories. 

### Existing or Related Solutions (Competitors)
There are two major existing services called ChangUp in(창업인 = Start up people) and MyPuCha(마이프차 = My Franchise).

* [**ChangUp in**](https://changupin.kr/) provides group chatting services to current owners and potential owners. 

* [**MyPuCha**](https://myfranchise.kr/) is a  franchise community and platform for both current and potential franchise owners.

### Plan for survey or interview
- First, we would like to start to interview the potential (meaning that people already preparing to open a café) and current café owners that we know of. Preferably, the interview will be held in-person if the interviewee allows (our team will visit the café or the place that interviewee prefers). We will also find more people to interview by asking interviewees their role model or cafes that they referred to.
