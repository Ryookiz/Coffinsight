After graduating from college, I thought it didn't fit well with my company life, and I wanted to work at a cafe formally as a good memory when I worked at a cafe. I felt a sense of accomplishment when I worked at a cafe after I quit my job and liked the drinks I made. So I wanted to start a business someday and make my own menu.

While working at a private cafe, I had more opportunities to listen to customers from various occupations, so I learned the charm of being able to experience a little indirectly in the industry that I don't know. As it is located in the neighborhood, I started with the idea that it would be nice to have a cafe where you can visit comfortably and share what happened that day after work even if it's not grand.

I took over the original cafe, so the overall interior was set. The name has changed and the arrangement of furniture and props has changed to give a new atmosphere. I wanted to make it fun for the people who come to see my space, so I added lights and props from time to time.

I think the basics should be solid. The basics of the cafe are coffee flavors, so we focus on that part. Even if you stop by, I hope you feel relaxed and happy enough. I hope it becomes a cafe that comes to mind twice.
</span><span class="v1_456">As I was doing it alone, it was the most difficult part at first to take responsibility for even the smallest things and make a decision. Everything is my job, so if I put it off for a while, the work to do doubles. I think it was really painful when two things came at once, when the moment of consecutive decisions was approaching and when I was behind in my work. However, thanks to this, I think my decision-making and procrastination habits have been fixed a little bit.
